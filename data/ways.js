However, the business of blogging often starts as a hobby, becomes a profitable side business, and then becomes a brand-new, all-encompassing career. One of the most beautiful and exciting qualities about blogging is that you can create a blog that deals with any subject area that you are either knowledgeable or passionate about (and preferably both!). You can write about personal finance, careers, real estate, getting into business, technology, cooking, travel, personal health, or just about any topic you choose. You can set up a website, gradually build up the content (articles, videos, podcasts, etc.), then eventually monetize the site through advertising, affiliate marketing, or even the direct sale of specific products or services. Even better, you can generally find whatever services and technical assistance you need online and free of charge. Later on, when your site develops a reliable cash flow, you can begin working with paid providers who can take your blog to the next level.'

The concept of taking surveys in exchange for money is simple, but you should do your research and tread lightly. This is also a business that had more than a few scam operations! I even hesitate to include this category, but the subject of how to make money online wouldn’t be complete without including online survey companies that are truly legitimate. Some will pay you cash to take surveys, but awarding points seems to be the more common method of compensation. You accumulate points by doing surveys, and the points can be redeemed for merchandise.`

It also is possible to get double-digit interest rate returns on your investment through peer-to-peer lending platforms, such as Lending Club and Prosper. When you consider the fact that bank investments typically pay less than 1%, it’s like getting 9% (or more) on your money for free! When you invest with peer-to-peer lending sites, you are effectively functioning as a lender, lending directly to the borrowers who come to the site. The borrowers are vetted and rated based on credit profile, income, and the purpose of the loan. You can earn above-average rates of return because peer-to-peer lending eliminates the bank function. That means that you participate in nearly the entire interest rate being paid by the borrower, rather than the less than 1% that you will typically earn with an online savings account. Not only that, but you can reduce your risk by investing in slices of hundreds of different loans.`

        Each year, companies spend trillions of dollars trying to capture the attention of large audiences.
        Due to the massive user-base Facebook garners, it has naturally become a hot-bed for companies – large and small – to spend some of their marketing budgets.
        Running Facebook Ads is great for small businesses because there is no minimum amount of monthly ad spend. So, if a business only has a spare $100 to run ads, that will do just fine.
        But, most small business owners simply don’t have the time or the know-how to run these ads.
        That is where you come in.
        By learning how to manage Facebook Ads for small companies, you can make a killing. And, (once you know what you’re doing) it really doesn’t take much work at all.
        Starting a Facebook ads business is simple:
        1.Learn how to run Facebook Ads.
        2.Reach out to local small businesses asking if they would like to expand their customer base through Facebook Ads.
        3.Propose a simple business relationship in which the company sets a monthly Facebook Ad budget and pays you to run the ads.

        The advantage with crafts is that they are creative in nature, and can work well if you are a creative type. In addition, since you are making the crafts, you’ll be able to better control your inventory, as well as the costs that go into it.`

All kinds of skills are needed, and compensation can vary anywhere between $10 per hour to $100 or more.

But you can do a variation of the strategy by buying used items and either repairing or restoring them and then selling them on Craigslist at a substantial markup.
        The advantage here is that items that are broken or deficient can often be had for next to nothing, or even completely free. If you have the skill, you may be able to restore them to a very usable condition with a few dollars and some elbow grease.
        Craigslist  even has a free section, where you can get items that people are just looking to get rid of – not to make any money. Why would they do this? Because it might actually cost them money to have the item hauled away by the trash company.
        If you can find and restore items like furniture and appliances, you can make a substantial amount of money. You can acquire the items on Craigslist, or even at garage sales or estate sales, restore them, and then list them for sale on the site. You may also be able to market certain items on eBay, particularly if they are small or unusual but at a high price.`

        text: ` Buy and Sell Used BooksThis is another favorite way to make money online! Everybody has used books somewhere in their home, and a website like BookScouter  can help you turn some of them into cash.
        BookScouter is actually a book buyer aggregator site. They work with dozens of companies that buy back books. You can enter the ISBN number on the site and it will connect you with the buyer that will pay the most for the book. You then send the book to the site in a prepaid envelope, and you will be paid within a few days.
        If you are good at finding valuable books in good condition, you may be able to turn this into a profitable side business. It’s another example of putting the buy low, sell high strategy to work for you.`

        text: `Complete Tasks with GigWalkThis is another variation of micro-projects, except that it is oriented toward doing tasks on the go. Gigwalk  enables you to sign up for the app and begin to receive job orders right away. Those orders come in on your iPhone, and you must be prepared to perform the task and to do it quickly and efficiently.
        As is typically the case with micro-projects, they are usually simple tasks that pay a few dollars each. The key is to complete as many tasks as possible, in the shortest amount of time. There are people who claim to be earning full-time equivalent salaries by fully committing to this venture.
        There are a variety of tasks that you may be asked to perform. This can include delivering documents, delivering food or restaurant meals, taking pictures of a building for a real estate developer, taking pictures of a menu in an upscale restaurant, or even delivering auto-parts. If you have a good working car (or even a good bicycle), time on your hands, and a lot of energy, this can be a real opportunity to make money online.`

It might actually be more accurate to say that it is a platform where skilled service providers can offer their services to site visitors, similar to Angie’s List.
        Zaarly is currently available in just three cities – Charlotte, Dallas – Fort Worth, and Kansas City – but we should suspect that it will add more as time goes on. The tasks are actual customer jobs, and generally more substantial than micro-tasks. They may even hold the opportunity to develop ongoing customer relationships.`

        They often expect you to commit to working a certain number of hours per week, which is generally part-time. They will pay you an hourly salary for that work, so it is really more of an at home job situation than it is in an entrepreneurial way to make money online. Still, if you want to get involved in political activity, and you have the time and motivation, this could be a way to monetize that passion.`

        1.Send your products to Amazon's fulfillment centers.
        2.Upload your listings to Seller Central.
        3.Let Amazon fullfill all or part of your inventory.
        4.print PDF labels provided by Amazon or use FBA's Label Service.
        5.Use Amazon's discounted shipping or select your own carrier.
        6.Amazon stores your products.
        7.Customer's order your products.
        8.Amazon fullfills orders placed directly on Amazon.com or fulfillment requests you submit for sales not on Amazon.
        9.Amazon picks and packs your products.
        10.Amazon ships your products.

        text: `Rent Out Your Unused Musical Instruments with FretishThere’s an excellent chance that you have one or several musical instruments sitting in storage that haven’t been used in years. Perhaps it’s a leftover from when you were in school, or even from your days playing in a band. Whatever the reason that you have it, it’s probably worth money if you can sell it. Brand-new instruments are ridiculously expensive, so people often look to buy used equipment instead, particularly if they are novices.
        You can make money online by selling your used instruments on a site called Fretish. Naturally, they’ll take a fee from the sales proceeds, but that will still enable you to make some money from an item that is just sitting around collecting dust.
        Also, if you know a good bit about musical instruments, and know-how and where to buy them on the cheap, you can use Fretish to sell them on an ongoing basis. That can turn into a nice side business, that eventually might grow into something more.`

But if you don’t use your car a whole lot, and would like to use it to earn some extra income – without doing any extra work – web platforms are available to make this happen.
        Sites like HyreCar and Turo  enable you to rent out your car hourly, daily, for a weekend, or even for a specific trip. Some advertise that you can make up to $10,000 per year renting out your car while you’re not using it.`

        text: `Host Travelers In Your HomeThe peer-to-peer concept is coming to virtually every corner of human existence. That includes the hospitality industry. Through the AirBnB website, you can actually rent out your house for various lengths of time for a predetermined fee. This lets you earn extra income on your house while giving the visitor the benefit of having an entire house versus being crammed into a single hotel room.
        Exactly how much you can earn from this activity depends on a variety of factors. Obviously, the size and amenities of your home are important and larger homes will fetch higher fees. The location of your home is also critical.Locations close to a large city or major recreational venues are perhaps the best candidates.
        The practice isn’t for everybody, but as AirBnB has become common across the globe, there are safeguards in place. If you tend to be out of town a lot, this can be an excellent way to earn additional income.`

But the theory of it makes it interesting! Basically, you use your car as a moving billboard, displaying advertisements for the general public. And if you don’t mind driving a car that’s covered in ad space, may be able to make several hundred dollars per month through My Free Car.
        Do some deep research on the company, and if it seems to be on the up and up, give it a try. You’re going to be driving anyway, and you know that it always costs money to keep and drive a car. You may as well earn some money doing what you’re going to do anyway, and this is an opportunity to make that happen. According to the company website, you can get paid up to $400 per month.

        It sounds too good to be true, but that’s exactly what HealthyWage will do. You sign up with the site, set your goal weight, and the amount of time that you expect to achieve it. You then place a bet of between $20 and $500 per month that you will make it.
